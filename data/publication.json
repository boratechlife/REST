        "Abstract": "A DNA methylation (DNAm) signature (the \"Horvath clock\") has been proposed as a measure of human chronological and biological age. We determined peripheral blood DNAm in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and assessed whether accelerated aging occurs in these patients. DNAm signatures were obtained in patients with biopsy-proven NASH and stage 2-3 fibrosis. The DNAm profile from one test and two validation cohorts served as controls. Age acceleration was calculated as the difference between DNAm age and the predicted age based on the linear model derived from controls. Hepatic collagen content was assessed by quantitative morphometry. The Horvath clock accurately predicts the chronological age of the entire cohort. Age acceleration was observed among NASH subjects compared with control data sets and our test controls. Age acceleration in NASH subjects did not differ by fibrosis stage but correlated with hepatic collagen content. A set of 152 differentially methylated CpG islands between NASH subjects and controls identified gene set enrichment for transcription factors and developmental pathways. Patients with NASH exhibit epigenetic age acceleration that correlates with hepatic collagen content."

        "Abstract": "Background & Aims: A DNA methylation (DNAm) signature derived from 353 CpG sites (the Horvath clock) has been proposed as an epigenetic measure of chronological and biological age. This epigenetic signature is accelerated in diverse tissue types in various disorders, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and is associated with mortality. Here, we assayed whole blood DNAm to explore age acceleration in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Methods: Using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850K) array, DNAm signatures in whole blood were analyzed in 36 patients with PSC enrolled in a 96-week trial of simtuzumab (Ishak F0-1, n = 13; F5-6, n = 23). Age acceleration was calculated as the difference between DNAm age and chronological age. Comparisons between patients with high and low age acceleration (>= vs. < the median) were made and Cox regression evaluated the association between age acceleration and PSC-related clinical events (e.g. decompensation, cholangitis, transplantation). Results: Age acceleration was significantly higher in patients with PSC compared to a healthy reference cohort (median, 11.1 years, p <2.2 x 10-16). In PSC, demographics, presence of inflammatory bowel disease, and ursodeoxycholic acid use were similar between patients with low and high age acceleration. However, patients with high age acceleration had increased serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, enhanced liver fibrosis test scores, and greater hepatic collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression on liver biopsy (all p <0.05). Moreover, patients with high age acceleration had an increased prevalence of cirrhosis (89% vs. 39%; p = 0.006) and greater likelihood of PSC-related events (hazard ratio 4.19; 95% CI 1.15-15.24). Conclusion: This analysis of blood DNAm profiles suggests that compared with healthy controls, patients with PSC - particularly those with cirrhosis - exhibit significant acceleration of epigenetic age. Future studies are required to evaluate the prognostic implications and effect of therapies on global methylation patterns and age acceleration in PSC. Lay summary: An epigenetic clock based on DNA methylation has been proposed as a marker of age. In liver diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, age acceleration based on this epigenetic clock has been observed. Herein, we show that patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis have marked age acceleration, which is further accentuated by worsening fibrosis. This measure of age acceleration could be a useful marker for prognostication or risk stratification in primary sclerosing cholangitis."

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Most patients with cirrhosis induced by chronic HBV infection experience fibrosis regression after long-term antiviral treatment, while some remain cirrhotic. Fibrosis regression is associated with lower odds of developing hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma, but mechanisms impacting differential fibrosis regression between individuals are unclear. We asked whether soluble molecules, including serum microRNAs, could serve as biomarkers of fibrosis regression. METHODS: We analyzed cryopreserved sera from clinical trials in which cirrhotic HBV-infected patients (baseline Ishak fibrosis score of 5-6) received 240 weeks of nucleotide analogue treatment. Liver biopsies at week 240 in these trials showed 71/96 patients (74%) had fibrosis regression (Ishak <= 4) while 25/96 (26%) remained cirrhotic (Ishak 5-6). We quantified inflammatory markers (CXCL10, soluble CD163) and miRNAs (n=179) from serum at baseline, week 48, and week 240 of treatment in a sub-cohort of patients with (n=14) or without (n=14) fibrosis regression. RESULTS: CXCL10, sCD163, and miRNAs previously associated with HBV replication and inflammation decreased during treatment but did not differ based on fibrosis regression. Two miRNAs (miR-421, miR-454-3p) had lower baseline expression in patients with subsequent fibrosis regression. 27 miRNAs differed at week 240 and had higher expression in patients with fibrosis regression (e.g. miR-199a-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-let-7d-5p). Several miRNAs (miR-141-3p, let-7d-5p) that correlated with regression have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: In cirrhotic patients with chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy, serum miRNAs have differential expression based on fibrosis regression, suggesting potential utility as biomarkers."

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy. (Funded by Gilead Sciences.)."

        "Abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a heterogeneous cholangiopathy characterized by progressive biliary fibrosis. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of liver tissue from PSC patients (n=74) enrolled in a 96-week clinical trial was performed to identify associations between biological pathways that were independent of fibrosis and clinical events. The effect of fibrosis was subtracted from gene expression using a novel computational approach. The fibrosis-adjusted gene expression patterns were associated with time to first PSC-related clinical event (e.g. cholangitis, hepatic decompensation) and differential expression based on risk groups and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were performed. Baseline demographic data were representative of PSC: median age 48 years, 71% male, 49% with IBD, and 44% with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. The first principle component (PC1) of RNA-Seq data accounted for 18% of variance and correlated with fibrosis stage (rho=-0.80; P<0.001). After removing the effect of fibrosis-related genes, PC1 was not associated with fibrosis (rho=-0.19; P=0.11) and a semi-supervised clustering approach identified two distinct patient clusters with differential risk of time to first PSC-related event (P<0.0001). The two groups had similar fibrosis stage, hepatic collagen content and alpha-SMA expression by morphometry, ELF score, and serum liver biochemistry, bile acids, and IL-8 (all p>0.05). The top pathways identified by IPA were eIF2 signaling and regulation of eIF4/p70S6K signaling. Genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), ATF6 and eIF2, were differentially expressed between the PSC clusters (down-regulated in the high-risk group by log-fold-changes of -0.18 [P=0.02] and -0.16 [P=0.02], respectively). Clinical events were enriched in the high versus low-risk group (38% [12/32] vs 2.4% [1/42], p<0.0001). Conclusions: Removing the contribution of fibrosis-related pathways uncovered alterations in the UPR, which were associated with liver-related complications in PSC."

        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling is a proposed target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Sensitivity to SYK inhibition has been linked to HOXA9 and MEIS1 overexpression in preclinical studies. This trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of entospletinib, a selective inhibitor of SYK, in combination with chemotherapy in untreated AML. METHODS: This was an international multicenter phase 1b/2 study: entospletinib dose escalation (standard 3+3 design between 200 mg and 400 mg BID) + 7+3 (cytarabine + daunorubicin) in phase 1b, and entospletinib dose expansion (400 mg BID) + 7+3 in phase 2. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (n=12 phase 1b, n=41 phase 2) with previously untreated de novo (n=39) or secondary (n=14) AML enrolled (58% male, median age 60 years). The composite complete response with entospletinib + 7+3 was 70%. Patients with baseline HOXA9 and MEIS1 expression higher than the median had improved overall survival compared to patients with below median HOXA9 and MEIS1 expression. Common adverse events were cytopenias, febrile neutropenia, and infection. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. Entospletinib-related skin rash and hyperbilirubinemia were also observed. CONCLUSION: Entosplentib with intensive chemotherapy was well tolerated in AML patients. Improved survival was observed in patients with HOXA9/MEIS1 overexpression, contrasting published data demonstrating poor survival in such patients. A randomized study will be necessary to determine whether entospletinib was a mediator this observation."
